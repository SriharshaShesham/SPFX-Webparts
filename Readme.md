# SPFX-Webparts

## Summary

As a person working in and out on SharePoint I had to design many applications that are based of SharePoint lists. So in most of my applications SharePoint lists are the backend and I design front end to it. And I feel it comfortable as we can update the UI by updating the list. I will host some of the useful SPFX Webparts and extensions here which are not available elsewhere on the web(at least by the time I created this).
